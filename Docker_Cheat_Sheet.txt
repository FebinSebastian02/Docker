1) docker run: Run a container(a running copy of it) from an image(Ready made package with app and it's environment). E.g.: Image - Class, Container -      Object. It will check in the host(your computer) first, if it's not present there it will pull down the image from docker host.
This command runs in a foreground/ attached mode. Output can only be viewed on the screen.
If the image is not official, we should type docker run [user id/repo name]

2) docker ps: Lists all running containers and some basic info about them

3) docker ps -a: Lists all current or previous exited containers

4) docker stop [container name/ container id]: Stop the container running. docker ps helps to get id / name.

5) docker rm [name/id of container]: To remove a exited container permanently.

6) docker images: see list of images and their sizes

7) docker rmi [repo name]: delete the images. To do this, their all dependent containers should be removed earlier

8) docker pull [repo]: just pull the image without running it

Container only exists till the task is finished.

9) docker exec [container id] [command]: To execute a command on the docker container

10) docker run -d [repo]: Runs the docker container in detached mode / background mode and you will be back to prompt immediately after this command.
Container continues to run in backend.

11) docker attach [few starting characters of id]: To attach back to the running container

12) docker run ubuntu sleep 20: This command lives for 20 sec and it's exited. Therefore, container also exits.

13) docker stop [container id/ container name]: To force kill a container.

14) docker run -d --name [preferred container name] image: To change container name to a desired one.

15) docker run [image]:4.0 - 4.0 is the tag which refers the version that should be ran. If tag is not explicitly given, default version is ran.

16) docker run -i [image]: To run in interactive mode

17) docker run -it [image]: The interactive mode along with prompt is ran

18) docker run -p 80:5000 [image]:To port map 80 of local host to 5000 on docker container. Website can be accessed using https://[internal ip]:[port]. Multiple instances of container can be run in multiple hosts

19) docker run -v [external directory]: [directory inside a container]: To port volume to a external directory, so that data is stored even after the removal of container.

20) docker inspect [container name/ id]: To get all details of container in json format

21) docker logs [container id/ name]: To see logs of container that we ran on background/detached mode.

22) docker run [image] sh -c "cat /etc/*release*": Gives the details on the version of container.

23) cat [command]: Print contents of file to the terminal.

24) pwd: Print current working directory

25) vim [file name]: To open in editor

26) i: For insert mode in editor

27) ESC + :wq!: For saving and closing editor 

28) ESC + :q!: For closing editor without saving

29) docker run -e APP_COLOR=blue [image]: To run container with an environment variable set

CREATING DOCKER IMAGE
Docker file: A text file written in specific format that the Docker can understand. It's in Instruction and Argument format.
Everything on the left in CAPS is an instruction. Everything on right is an argument to those instructions.

All Docker files start with a FROM instruction.

1. FROM Ubuntu: Defines what the base OS should be for this container. Every docker image must be based off of another image, either an OS or other image created before based on OS.

2. RUN apt -get update && apt -get -y install python
   RUN pip install flask flask -mysql
   Install all dependencies. This instructs Docker to run a particular command on those base images.
   Here, apt get update command fetches updated packages and installs required dependencies on the image.

3. COPY . /opt/source-code: Copies file from local system onto docker image. Source code is in current folder. This is copied to opt/source-code inside Docker image.

4. ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP=/souce-code/app.py flask run: Specify a command that will be run when image is run as a container.

Docker builds images in a layered architecture. All layers are cached which helps in using previous layers if any of the layers(steps) in between is crashed.

5. docker build . : TO build image

PUSHING TO DOCKER HUB
1. docker build . -t febin/test-app: Tag image with user name
2. docker login: Give user name and pass
3. dokcer push febin/test-app
